# Processing a task (how to)
## 1 - **Question** it
Did you understand the task? Does it make sense to you? Does it make sense as part of the whole project? Have you all the required information and material to work on that task?

## 2 - **Concept**ualize a solution
First thing first, think about what you want to accomplish. How will you do it ? Take the time to think and choose a path that seems smart to you.

## 3 - Call for a peer **design review**
Before going any further ask your peers to review the path you want to take.
They perhaps have some experience about the kind of problem you're trying to solve. Allow them to share their tricks and experience with you, stay open minded, it's potentially time to learn something. Possibly they already have took that path and can avoid you to take one they know is wrong. It's time for you to explain your choices and to immediatly see if your way seems obvious to others or totally weird and clumsy, or if you feel unconfortable justifying your choices.

## 4 - **Implement** the design
Now that your peers seem ok with you about the path to take, it is yours to implement the solution. Having think about it before instead of jumping in head first, you will probably implement it faster.

## 5 - **Test** your creation
Before asking anyone to take a look at your work, you must ensure it does what it is intended for. It's not a pleasure for the reviewer to discover a non fonctional implementation, and it's no more pleasant to show a broken code to other.

## 6 - Ask for a peer **code review**
Now it's time to ask your fellows a code review. Having discussed with you earlier about the path you should have taken to implement the solution you shouldn't be discussing about big mistakes anymore. You should now have little details to review like coding style or variables nomenclature. It will avoid great frustration for you as you won't have to rewrite a full two days work, or worst trying to patch a bad implementation to feat the reviewers expectations.

## 7 - **Check** it in pre-production
You **must** check it in pre-production environment as it may differ from your development one.

## 8 - **Deliver** it â†’ switch to next task
You're doing a great job :)
